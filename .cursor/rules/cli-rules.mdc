# C rules
* Use CMake to compile your code, always make sure it compiles after a batch of changes
* Test your work using the credentials provided
* The client should return struct's which can be easily destroy/free'd after processing
* Use other commands as examples when creating new commands
* DRY - do not repeat yourself, break code into reusable pieces
* Use openssl for cryptographic operations
* Use memory safe string functions wherever possible
